# Northwind Database Project

## Overview
This project involves analyzing the Northwind database using SQL queries. The goal is to perform various data analysis tasks, including product price segmentation and comparison of current and previous product prices. The results can be visualized using Power BI.

## Contents
The project contains the following SQL queries:
  * Product Price Segmentation: This query segments products based on their unit prices into different price ranges and counts the number of products in each segment.
  * Product Price Comparison: This query compares the current and previous prices of products and calculates the percentage increase or decrease in price.

## Visualization with Power BI
To visualize the results of these queries, you can use Power BI. Import the data obtained from the queries into Power BI and create visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and tables to better understand the data insights.

## How to Use
Run the SQL queries in your preferred SQL environment connected to the Northwind database.
Export the results to a CSV file.
Import the CSV file into Power BI.
Create visualizations to represent the data insights.
  ### Requirements
SQL Server or any SQL-compatible database system.
Power BI Desktop for data visualization.
## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Northwind database, focusing on product pricing. The SQL queries help in understanding price segmentation and price changes over time, which can be crucial for business decisions. The visualizations in Power BI further enhance the insights derived from the data.
